## So why a ranklist app?
So the idea is simple. We recieve our semester-wise results in the form of a pdf, which looks like this:

There's Roll Number-wise, Subject-wise result of each and every student studying in a branch (CSE for instance) in the entire university (that's right, not just one college). Neither total marks nor percentage is displayed, let alone a ranklist. Even the subject names are not shown corresponding to the marks.

So this is a minimalist result website I'm making for our University students, in which they can see their class-rank, percentage and subject-wise marks.

## History
Before starting with this application I created an [MSIT Ranklist web-app for Fall'18 results](http://msitranklist.surge.sh/), which went exceptionally viral in MSIT and received more than 500 hits within the first two hours of launch. It has received **12,000+ hits** uptil now, which essentially inspired me create one for entire IP University. See the story of how I ended up making that application [here](https://github.com/ankushgarg1998/msit-ranklist).
